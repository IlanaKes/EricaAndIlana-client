# PARAMETERS

# -- PROBABLY THE SAME FOR EVERY FLIGHT IN LABS 1-10 --

# Specify the uri of the drone to which you want to connect (if your radio
# channel is X, the uri should be 'radio://0/X/2M/E7E7E7E7E7')
uri = 'radio://0/60/2M/E7E7E7E7E7'

# Specify the name of the rigid body that corresponds to your active marker
# deck in the motion capture system. If your marker deck number is X, this name
# should be 'marker_deck_X'.

# Specify the marker IDs that correspond to your active marker deck in the
# motion capture system. If your marker deck number is X, these IDs should be
# [X + 1, X + 2, X + 3, X + 4]. They are listed in clockwise order (viewed
# top-down), starting from the front.

# this flight does not use a custom controller. This file is written by your
